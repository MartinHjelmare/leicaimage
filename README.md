# leicaimage

Handle Leica Matrix Screener experiment images

The leicaimage library is a modified version of the
[leicaexperiment](https://github.com/arve0/leicaexperiment) library,
and was built as a drop in replacement for that library but without any xml
or image processing. This also makes leicaimage work without heavy dependencies.

# leicaimage

Handle Leica Matrix Screener experiment images

The leicaimage library is a modified version of the [leicaexperiment](https://github.com/arve0/leicaexperiment),
and was built as a drop in replacement for that library but without any xml or image processing.
This also makes leicaimage work without heavy dependencies.
